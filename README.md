# CS250

To interpret what users need and put it into a program, I start by listening to their feedback and turning their requests into clear, actionable features. Writing user stories helps a lot with this because it breaks down what the user wants, why it’s important, and how it will help them. This makes it easier to plan and prioritize the work, making sure the program delivers value to the user.

When I develop programs, I like to break down the work into smaller tasks and focus on making continuous improvements. Using Agile practices like sprints, daily check-ins, and retrospectives helps me stay organized and adjust quickly to changes. Moving forward, I plan to keep using these practices, especially user stories and iterative development, because they provide flexibility and ensure I’m delivering valuable features to users.

Being a good team member in software development means communicating well, collaborating with others, and contributing to the team’s success. It’s important to support teammates, share feedback, and stay aligned with the team’s goals. Agile practices like daily standups and retrospectives are key for keeping everyone on the same page and always improving how the team works together.
